    "# Part 1: Creating a Submodular Function\n",
    "How is a submodular function presented or represented? \n",
    "Let $V = \\{ 1, 2, \\dots n \\}$ be a ground set and let $f: 2^V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a submodular set function. \n",
    "Note that the function is specified by $2^n$ values; however, storing all these values (let alone looking them up) would require exponential space and (perhaps) time.\n",
    "For this reason, we assume that a submodular function is presented in the *value oracle model*, meaning that our algorithms have access to a function that takes a set $S$ as input and outputs the value $f(S)$.\n",
    "This is the model that is used in the literature and, roughly speaking, this is the model that is accepted by the algorithms in our package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can either define a submodular function or use a pre-specified one. At this time, we have two pre-specified functions: (1) weighted vertex cover and (2) facility location. Our algorithms all require only a *marginal gain value oracle* which is a function that takes a set $S$ and an element $e$ as input and outputs the marginal gain \n",
    "$$f( e \\mid S) \\triangleq f(S \\cup e) - f(S)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.1 Vertex Cover\n",
    "Now, we show how to use one of our pre-built marginal gain functions for weighted vertex cover.\n",
    "Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ with non-negative weights on the vertices (denoted $w_u$ for all $u \\in V$), the *weighted vertex cover* function $f: 2^V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as \n",
    "$$ f(S) =  \\sum_{u \\in N(S)} w_u \\enspace,$$\n",
    "where $N(S) = \\{ u \\in V \\mid u \\in S \\text{ or } u \\text{ is adjacent to } S \\}$ is the neighborhood set of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our graphs for the weighted vertex cover will be specified by adjacency dictionaries. For our test example, we will consider the following graph: for each $r = 2, 3, \\dots$ define $G_r$ as the disjoint union of complete graphs $K_2, K_3, \\dots K_{r}$. This graph is nice because we can easily reason about the greedy algorithm and the constrained maximization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by creating the adjacency dictionary for this graph."

    "## Part 4: Continuous Greedy\n",
    "In this section, we show how to use our pre-built code to run a relax-and-round framework, based on the so-called *continuous greedy* algorithm (for maximizing the relaxation) and swap-rounding (for rounding to a discrete solution).\n",
    "We also provide support for several faster variants of the continuous greedy algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't get into too much detail about how the continuous greedy algorithm works here, but we do need to get technical enough to describe the variants.\n",
    "The continuous greedy algorithm seeks to optimize the *multilinear relaxation* of a submodular set function subject to a matroid constraint.\n",
    "It is a Frank-Wolfe type algorithm, which requires computing the gradient and linear maximization over the matroid.\n",
    "However, exact gradients are generally not available to us when using the multilinear extension, so we have to make do with stochastic gradient estimates. \n",
    "To this end, there are three approaches (i.e. the variants) to the continuous greedy algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Averaging** The true gradient $\\nabla F(x_t)$ is approximated by averaging *many* stochastic gradient estimates. This technique essentially requires that the gradient estimate $d_t$ is very close to $\\nabla F(x)$ at every iteration, requiring $O(n^2)$ stochastic gradient estimates for the Chernoff bounds to go through. This is costly, but provides a $(1 - 1/e - \\epsilon)$-approximate solution with high probability.\n",
    "2. **Momentum** Another idea is to maintain a gradient estimate $d_t$ except that now we would like $\\| \\nabla F(x_t) - d_t \\|_2$ to be decreasing in $t$. The trick in the analysis is to show that by certain variance-reduction tricks (also known as momentum), the error in the gradient estimates $\\| \\nabla F(x_t) - d_t \\|_2$ decrease at a rate which is asymptotically faster than the gain in the objective. The result is that we can use fewer gradient estimates at each iteration, but we require more iterations. The guarantee of this variant is slightly weaker- we get a solution which is a $(1 - 1/e - \\epsilon)$-approximate solution in expectation (as oppposed to with high probability).\n",
    "3. **Spider** A more refined method for maintaining a gradient estimate with decreasing error is the *Stochastic Path Integrated Differential Estimator* (SPIDER). The main computational primative is to approximate a Hessian-vector product, which yields a good gradient estimate. Again, this technique uses fewer gradient estimates, more iterations, and provides a  $(1 - 1/e - \\epsilon)$-approximate solution in expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note to self**: We need to include simple, easy to read guarantees on the batch size and number of iterations, or have this pre-set as a function of the tolerance $\\epsilon$ in the approximation guarantee. The guarantees aren't completely obvious in the literature (which has, perhaps unfortunately, focused on general DR-submodular functions, abstracting away the structure in the multilinear-extensions) and so it'd be good to simply collect them in one place for multilinear extension and matroid constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code also uses the swap-rounding *at each iteration* to maintain a sequence of sets that have the same approximation guarantees as the continuous iterations. There are no variants here and so we don't discuss them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4.1 The Averaged (Expensive) Continuous Greedy\n",
    "Okay let's see how to use our code. First, we'll start with the original **Averaging** variant. As an example, we'll use the simplest matroid (a uniform matroid) and our earlier vertex cover example, so we can better reason about whether the output of the code seems correct. We're setting the batch size *very* large ($B = 2^n$), so it gets near exact gradient estimates."

Can we observe that the last set $S_T$ is usually a good enough approximation? Are there conditions under which this is true or can we find counterexamples where we need to round because the last many iterates are bad?\n",
    "2. **Order of Rounding** Suppose that the first few sets $S_1 = S_2 = \\dots = S_{d}$ are the same not so good solution ($d << T$). Then unforuntately there is a higher probability of keeping that solution throughout the algorithm. Do we (at least heuristically) get a better performance if we do swap rounding in a backwards order? How about a random order?\n",
